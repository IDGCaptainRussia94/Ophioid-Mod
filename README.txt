Version History :

V2.06
So remember when I said there wouldn't be a treasure bag? Well as it turns out Kranot DID make one and I forgot to add it, so here you go! It only drops from the rematch however
Did a sort of hard-counter to make the music play properly
Discovered a bug, it's rare and how to cause it: by having no NPCs in your world. Something that's bound to not happen anyways, but if there are no NPCs, the boss with spawn with only 1 segment. So if you have this problem, this is why.


V2.04
Added unfinished music tracks for the rematch, read below why they are unfinished and for an annoucement.
The Fly phase was aparently missing its custom health bar support from YABHB, fixed.

V2.03
The Worm phase has received a slightly stronger velocity cap when charging at the player. Furthermore, when airborne, if Ophoiopede is too far away from the player, his X velocity will slow down and he will become less likely to despawn

V2.01
Updated to the new TMODLoader

-Disclaimer
So some time ago Kranot and I stopped talking and I recently cut contact with him all together, So there won't be any more sprites being made (by him atleast), and that means no more content outside of what was planned.
I don't think he even knows I finished 'his' mod, as he likes to view it.
I have been working on a content mod I am very passionate about called SGAmod and am looking for spriters
Check it out, if you like Ophioid-Mod, you'll like SGAmod <3
