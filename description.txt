Now Ported over and rebuild for TModLoader 1.4 Alpha!
Ophioid is a mod focused on a boss and a multi-phase rematch later on that cuts down on soul griding in hardmode after the mecha bosses.
Source code available on github (1.4 branch)
Please see https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/the-ophioid-mod.73083/ for more info on the mod

With the introduction of the 1.4 Port, some things have changed, see V2.15

Current Content:
-2 summoning items for both evil biomes and 1 for the rematch fight
-2(2nd boss has 3 phases) Bosses (With trophy and mask and a pet item!)

Version History :

V2.15
Is now running on TML 1.4! The following has changed, going forward or only for now:
-The bosses drop variable ammounts of items and even more in Expert due to how 1.4 handles item drops now, getting a solid 50 items to drop BEFORE luck I havn't figured out yet.
-There is NO netcode support, all NetCode methods in 1.4 TML appear to be broken and inaccessible.
-Boss Checklist and Yet Another Boss Healthbar Support has been disabled
-IDGLib is no longer required by the mod
-Projectiles don't make you Stinky
-Any other shanigans 1.4 might have introduced are very likely
