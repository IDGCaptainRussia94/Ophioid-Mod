Now Ported over and rebuild for tModLoader 1.4!

V2.15
Is now running on TML 1.4! The following has changed, going forward or only for now:
-The bosses drop variable amounts of items and even more in Expert due to how 1.4 handles item drops now, getting a solid 50 items to drop BEFORE luck I haven't figured out yet.
-There is NO netcode support, all NetCode methods in 1.4 TML appear to be broken and inaccessible.
-Music is currently busted in TML, so the mod's OST cannot be heard yet
-Boss Checklist and Yet Another Boss Healthbar Support has been disabled
-IDGLib is no longer required by the mod
-Projectiles don't make you Stinky
-Any other shenanigans 1.4 might have introduced are very likely
